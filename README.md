# onlinecultchallenge

An rgb input image(in .png format) is converted to gray scale, and rotated by 90 degrees. Then all the edges in it are detected and passed to a turtle. The turtle draws these edges on the canvas.
There are some adjustments made to handle pixel coordinates and canvas coordinates. The code is written in python. The libraries used are opencv, numpy, scipy, and turtle.
